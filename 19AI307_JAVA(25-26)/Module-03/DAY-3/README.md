# Ex.No:3(C) ABSTRACTION

## QUESTION:
Create abstract class GameScore with method finalScore().
Subclasses:
ArcadeGame: score = baseScore + (level × 100)
PuzzleGame: score = (attempts ≤ 3) ? 1000 - (attempts × 100) : 500

## AIM:

To Create abstract class GameScore with method finalScore().

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Import the necessary package 'java.util'
3.	Based on the game type, create the corresponding object:ArcadeGame then read base score and level ,PuzzleGame then read number of attempts.
4.	Through runtime polymorphism, call the overridden method finalScore() of the respective game class.
5.	Compute the score based on game rules:ArcadeGame: baseScore + (level × 100)
6.	PuzzleGame: if attempts ≤ 3 → 1000 − attempts × 100; else → 500
7.	Print the final score and stop.

            return;

        System.out.println(game.finalScore());
